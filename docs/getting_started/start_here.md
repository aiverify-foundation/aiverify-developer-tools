# Getting Started

The developer guide is designed to be beginner-friendly for developers, but assumes some familiarity and proficiency in [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.10/), [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/).

## Learning Objectives

You will learn to:

1. Install AI Verify Developer Tools
2. Introduction to AI Verify Plugins
3. Create an algorithm component that will return the values of a selected feature of your test dataset
4. Create an widget component that will print out the output from the algorithm component
5. Package algorithm and widget components into a single deployable plugin
6. Debugging workflow other avenues to seek help

## System Requirements

To start developing on AI Verify, you will need to install AI Verify Developer Tools. These are the minimum requirements to run AI Verify on a local computer:

- OS Requirements: Ubuntu 22 (64-bit) or MacOS
- Disk Space: >= 3GB disk space
- RAM: >= 4GB memory

!!! warning
    We do not officially provide support for Windows. For Windows developers, AI Verify requires minimally Windows 10 **with WSL2**. Please note that we have not conducted tests on Windows 10. Please follow instructions to set up WSL2 [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you still wish to proceed.

## Installing AI Verify Developer Tools

Upon installing AI Verify, please proceed with the installation of the [Developer Tools](install_aiverify_dev_tools.md).

## Building your first AI Verify plugin

In this tutorial, you will learn about the fundamental concepts to build a plugin. This guide will walk you through building your first AI Verify plugin using both Javascript and Python, and by the end you will have a working plugin that can be loaded on AI Verify to run an algorithm and generate a simple report.
