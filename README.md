## Introduction

Welcome to AI Verify! AI Verify is launched under the [AI Verify Foundation](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=20230607_AI_Verify_Foundation_GitHub), a subsidiary under the IMDA.

[AI Verify](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/what-is-ai-verify/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=20230607_AI_Verify_GitHub) is an AI governance testing framework and software toolkit that validates the performance of AI systems against a set of internationally recognised principles through standardised tests. AI Verify is consistent with international AI governance frameworks such as those from European Union, OECD and Singapore.

It is a single integrated toolkit that operates within an enterprise environment. It can perform technical tests on common supervised learning classification and regression models for most tabular and image datasets. It however does not define AI ethical standards and does not guarantee that any AI system tested will be free from risks or biases or is completely safe.
